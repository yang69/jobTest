 * Give a undirected graph, each edge’s length is 1,
 * each node has a numeric ID. There are some special
 * nodes in the graph, node’s the minimum distance to
 * the special node is the length of shortest path to the
 * nearest special node. Please calculate all the nodes’
 * minimum distance to special node. If a node could not
 * reach any special node the distance is –1.
 *
 * 输入描述:
 * First line is a number N means that the next N lines
 * are the N edges in the graph. Each of the N lines has
 * two value v1 v2 which are the two nodes’ ID linked by
 * this edge. 0 < N < 10000000
 * After that there is a single line with a number M which
 * means the next M lines are the M special nodes. Each of
 * the M lines has one value v which means the node’s ID.
 * 0 <= M <= N/2
 *
 * 输出描述:
 * Sum of All nodes' minimum distance
 *
 * 输入例子:
 * 2
 * 1 2
 * 2 3
 * 1
 * 2
